# Face-Mask-Detection-System
This is a deep learning-based real-time face mask detection system built with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of images with and without face masks using a MobileNetV2 architecture. Once trained, it is capable of detecting faces in live video feeds and predicting whether or not each detected face is wearing a mask.
